# Finance Related Pet Projects
This page is just for experimentation purposes, where I do various projects related to financ, mathematical finance, ML/DL and optimisations.
It is recommended that these are downloaded and opened in JypterNotebook to avoid errors and limitations in/of Google Colab.
NOTE: Some are not my original codes (few are slightly modified by me) and some are. These are things I have found on the internet, textbooks and other useful resources. I am just sharing these with whoever will find it useful.
